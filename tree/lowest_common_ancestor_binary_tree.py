# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
# 
# Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
# "The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T 
# that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).""

# For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. 
# Another example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, 
# since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
