# Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path
# where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.
#
# Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
#
# Example 1:
# Input:
#
#               5
#              / \
#             4   5
#            / \   \
#           1   1   5
# Output:
# 2
#
# Example 2:
# Input:
#
#               1
#              / \
#             4   5
#            / \   \
#           4   4   5
# Output:
# 2
#
# Note: The given binary tree has not more than 10000 nodes. The height of the tree is not more than 1000.
