# 733. Flood Fill
# 
# An image is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image 
# (from 0 to 65535).
# 
# Given a coordinate (sr, sc) representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, 
# and a pixel value newColor, # "flood fill" the image.# 
# 
# To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of # the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels 
# (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. 
# Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.# 
# 
# At the end, return the modified image.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
# sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
# Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
# Explanation: 
# From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
# by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
# Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
# to the starting pixel.
