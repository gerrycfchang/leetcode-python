# 695. Max Area of Island

# Given a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally 
# (horizontal or vertical.) # 
# You may assume all four e# dges of the grid are surrounded by water.# 
# 
# Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
# 
# Example 1:
# [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
#  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
#  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
# Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
# Example 2:
# [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
