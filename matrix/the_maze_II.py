# 505. The Maze II
# 
# There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces and walls. 
# The ball can go through empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, 
# but it won't stop rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.
# 
# Given the ball's start position, the destination and the maze, find the shortest distance for the ball to stop at the destination. 
# The distance is defined by the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position (excluded) to the destination (included). 
# If the ball cannot stop at the destination, return -1.
# 
# The maze is represented by a binary 2D array. 
# 1 means the wall and 0 means the empty space. You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls. 
# The start and destination coordinates are represented by row and column indexes.
#
