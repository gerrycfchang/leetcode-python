# 492. Construct the Rectangle
# 
# For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. 
# So, given a specific rectangular web page's area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, 
# whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
# 
# 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
# 
# 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
# 
# 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
# You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
# Example:
# Input: 4
# Output: [2, 2]
