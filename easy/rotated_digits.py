X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, 
we get a valid number that is different from X. 
A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8 rotate to themselves; 
2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each other, 
and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?
